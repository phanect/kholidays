:: If a "Public Holiday" is on a Sunday, the first following day which is not
:: a "Public Holiday" shall be a substitute holiday.  If a day which is not a
:: "Public Holiday" is between two "Public Holidays", it shall be a citizens'
:: holiday.  Substitute holidays and citizens' holidays are not legally "Public
:: Holidays" (so in particular not for the purpose of determining such
:: holidays), but they are identical in practice.
